    <h2>Registration & submission</h2>
    <p>
        All students are welcome to join the Digital Tabletop Competition. To enter, simply create an account and join a team on this website.
    </p>
    <p>
        To submit your bot, upload its source code. The source code must consist of one single file, with maximally the size of a floppy (1,474,560 bytes).
        There are two submission deadlines; see the timeline at the end of this document.
        You can submit multiple times, but only the last version before the deadline will be considered.
    </p>

    <h2>Technical rules</h2>

    <h3>Input and output</h3>
    <p>
        Your bot will play 1v1 matches against other bots.
        At the beginning of a match your bot is started. It will run until the end of that game.
        Your bot should read input from standard input and write output to standard output.
        See the <a href="io-specification.html">I/O specification</a> for a more detailed description of this communication.
    </p>

    <h3>Programming languages</h3>
    <p>
        You may write your bot in:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>C#, which will be run with .NET 6.0.202</li>
        <li>Java, which will be run with OpenJDK 8 (update 312)</li>
        <li>Python, which will be run with PyPy 7.3.9 (Python 3.8.13)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The specific commands we use for this can be found in the default configuration generated by the <a href="runner-guide.html">runner</a> on first run.
    </p>

    <h3>Runtime environment</h3>
    <p>
        Submissions will be run on an Ubuntu (20 LTS) system.
        While playing a match, bots are limited to a single CPU core of 2.20 GHz. Your bot may use at most 30 seconds of computation time for the whole match. Only time that your bots spends to compute the next move is measured (not the time your opponent spends). If the time limit is exceeded, you lose the match. Furthermore, your bot may not use more than 2 GB of memory.
        Note that if your system at home is more powerful, you have to be careful.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your bot is not allowed to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>import packages other than the language's standard library</li>
        <li>read/write files</li>
        <li>make network connections</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Breaking the above rules results in disqualification.
    </p>

    <h2>Tournament & ranking</h2>
    <p>
        Bots are run against each other to determine the ranking. We will play a full tournament, meaning that each team plays against all other teams. In particular, per pair of teams, 3 seeds are generated. For each seed, two games are played: each team may start once. Hence, in total, 6 games are played between each pair of teams.
    </p>
    <p>
        During a game, the point system determines the winner. For further details, refer to the <a href="game-rules.html">game rules</a>.
        <!-- Your submission will be run by the jury. Therefore, it should be able to cooperate with the jury software, otherwise it will not be placed for the tournament. -->
        Each win will grant a team 2 competition points, each tie 1 competition point, and each loss 0 competition points.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the first deadline on May 11, an intermediate ranking will be published to see how well your bot performs against others. This ranking will not count towards the final standing, which is solely determined by the final competition after the second deadline on May 21.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Digital Tabletop Competition is won by the team with the greatest number of competition points. If a tie occurs, the team with the greatest number of game points (i.e., the total amount of points earned across all played games) wins the competition.
        If this does not resolve the tie, both teams win.
        Exceeding the time limit, making an invalid move, or crashing results in a final game score of -50 for that game.
    </p>

    <h2>Prizes</h2>
    <p>
        Each member of the winning team of the final competition will be awarded a prize. Each member of the team in second place will also receive a small prize.
    </p>
